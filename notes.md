# Learning the Meaning of Music

## Musical meaning

**Musical meaning** is the relationship between the signal and its interpretation. Goal is to *predict* musical meaning. This creates two questions: how can we represent musical meaning, and how can we extract meaning where none yet exists? (Meaning doesn't yet exist when a community hasn't heard the music in question)

## Types of meaning
- **correspondence**: how the artist interpreted the musical idea [p. 20]
    + what the music is about
    + how the music was made
    + _explicit correspondence_: an absolutist form of meaninng
        * notes and structure of a composition
        * timbres and effects used
- **relational**: how the community interpreted the importance of the artist and its relationship to others [p. 21]
    + connection between music and other music
    + gives insight into personal preference and organization
    + gives insight into music similarity
    + meaningless "big 5" genres: rock, pop, electronic, world, jazz 
    + styles: "edited form of relational meaning that link a small subset of artists into a like-minded cluster"
    + context-based classification (good for IDM, country) vs. signal-based classification (good for rap, metal, country)
    + similar well-known artists and songs used to communicate musical experience to readers
        * good data source: [AMG](http://www.allmusic.com/)
- **reaction**: how the listener personally interpreted the musical idea [p. 23]
    + conveys emotions (sadness, joy), physical states (dancing), reminds of past experiences
    + causes listeners to _listen_ to it (best captured as personal usage data)
    + necessary for music understanding or you ignore the listener entirely
    + _significance_: a form of aggregated cultural reaction that informs preference, notice, or popularity. Captured by the cultural channel that filters a musical messages towards a listener. Embedded in buzz, trends, peer opinion, and critical reaction. 
        * related to usage or appearances in discussion
        * valuable form of extra-signal meaning because can directly relate to preference and taste
        * can shape future music
        * current music understanding systems - e.g. collaborative filtering - capture significance via sales data, but do not grasp larger view of trends and buzz because it's not reflected in sales
